Seek by iNaturalist is an AR mobile app designed to encourage people, especially families, kids, and beginners, to explore nature and learn about plants, animals, fungi, and other organisms around them. It uses image recognition technology to identify species from photos you take with your phone's camera. It has easy nature identification by just pointing your phone's camera at a plant, insect, bird, mushroom, or other organism, and the app will suggest what it might be.
