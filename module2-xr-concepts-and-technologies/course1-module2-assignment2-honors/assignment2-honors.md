Complete Anatomy is an interactive 3D human anatomy platform designed to make learning anatomy more visual, spatial, and clinically relevant. It replaces static textbooks with dynamic, explorable content and is especially powerful when paired with AR or used in medical education environments.

Ask questions about the design of specific elements, e.g.:
How to display the selected organ or structure of the human body?

How to obtain the detailed information of the selected organ or anatomical structure?

How to monitor the movement or blood flow of the heart?

How to manipulate the size of selected body part?

How to collaborate around the human skeleton?

List design alternatives, not just related options, e.g.:
2D vs. 360 vs. 3D content

Hand-held vs. projective/spatial vs. monitor-based display

Marker-based vs. marker-less tracking

Establish criteria that can be objectively assessed and weighed, e.g.:
Works on any device (only requires camera and marker but no additional sensor)

No need for instrumentation (no need for placing a marker in the environment)

Can move around (without paying attention to keeping the marker in view)
