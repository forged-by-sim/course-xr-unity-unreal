Prompt
Design Context

In a few sentences, describe the design context in which your project is situated. Make it clear whether you have been designing for AR or VR.

This project is situated within a VR educational museum context, designed to transform passive observation into active, immersive learning. The user begins in a traditional museum setting, standing before a mounted Rhomaleosaurus skeleton, and then transitions into a fully immersive 360° underwater VR experience. The design leverages virtual reality (VR) to bring extinct creatures to life, allowing users to interact through gaze-based triggers, toggle between layered information (e.g., anatomy vs. environment), and engage in dynamic scenes like predatory behavior, which are all framed within an expedition-like XR storytelling experience.  




Prompt
Design Process

Briefly describe your design process around key milestones and mention any methods and tools used throughout.

The design process began with a design critique of an existing 360° VR experience, identifying areas for improvement using the I Like / I Wish / What If framework. Based on these insights, I developed storyboards that mapped out the user journey across three key scenes, such as static fossil exhibit, underwater transformation, and predatory interaction. I then created physical prototypes using diorama-style modeling and followed up with digital prototypes and VR-style mockups to visualize the layered interactions. Throughout the process, I used methods like think-aloud reflection, wireframing, and sketching, and tools including paper, clay models, Photoshop-style digital renderings, and prompt-based visual generation to simulate immersive environments and interfaces.  




Prompt
Storyboards, Physical & Digital Prototypes

Submit photos or a video of your final prototype walking us through your design. Please include storyboards and physical prototypes, not just the final digital prototypes.

Prompt
New Design Idea

Provide a description of your new idea. Summarize the key interactions you have implemented in your prototype in support of this new idea.

The new idea introduces a layered interaction system within a VR museum-to-ocean expedition, allowing users to toggle between different learning perspectives, such as fossil structure, anatomical function, environmental context, and behavioral insights, rather than overwhelming them with static information.

A “Bring to Life” gaze-triggered button, transforming the static fossil into a living Rhomaleosaurus. Floating info overlays that appear contextually when the user gazes at different parts of the creature (e.g., fins, teeth). A narration toggle to activate audio explanations. A choice-based toggle system that lets users switch between “Creature Facts” and “Environment Facts,” empowering them to guide their own learning. 

All these key interactions were implemented. These interactions shift the experience from passive viewing to personalized, immersive exploration within a VR environment.





Prompt
Design Decisions and Rationale

Describe your new idea and describe which changes and extensions it required to the existing design. Provide a rationale for your design decisions when implementing your new idea. Refer to lectures or readings with citations to back up your design decisions.

My new idea transforms a passive VR fossil viewing experience into an interactive, layered educational journey. It introduces a gaze-activated “Bring to Life” button that transitions the fossil into a swimming Rhomaleosaurus. Users can interact with floating info overlays that appear only when gazing at specific body parts, reducing cognitive overload. A narration toggle allows users to control when they receive audio explanations. Most importantly, a toggle system lets users switch between “Creature Facts” and “Environment Facts,” supporting self-directed learning. These changes required reworking the experience from a linear sequence to a modular, user-driven design. The interaction design follows principles discussed in lectures on affordances, autonomy, and feedback (Nebeling, Week 2 & Design Ethics). This approach turns VR into an immersive, educational tool that prioritizes clarity, choice, and depth.
